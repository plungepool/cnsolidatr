**CAUTION: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
MAKE A PLAN TO REGULARLY BACK UP YOUR DATA AND STICK TO IT
WITHOUT PROPER BACKUPS, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF 'IF' YOU'LL LOSE DATA ONE DAY - IT'S 'WHEN'!!**

## What is this?

cnsolidatr creates reusable templates for repetitive tasks involving copying and bringing together files from multiple sources that meet user-defined parameters. This is most useful for professionals in creative fields that involve keeping a folder intended for a client up-to-date with the latest versions of rendered files.

## How does it work?

Open the applet. Create a new file that'll hold all your settings for a project or load up an existing one. You'll select a destination folder, then a bunch of folders you want to pull the latest files from. Peruse the additional options if you like and hit the CNSOLIDAT button. The script will run and now you'll have all your most recent exports in a folder that you can hand striaght to your client! Best of all, now that it's set up you can run the same process from the saved project file you've created again and again.

## What is there still to add?

* Create optional backup of files currently in destination folder instead of moving to trash
* Options for file extension and/or filename prefix
* Specify the number of files to retrieve from each source folder
* Alternative criteria for copying files besides last modified
* Expanded OS support

## Why make this?

I've been an audio engineer for the past six or so years, the most common DAW found in professional recording studios is Pro Tools. Pro Tools, unlike other popular DAWs, provides a default location within every session file to store all *bounces* of a track(i.e. *mixes* or exports). While it's optional, many prefer using it because it keeps things neat and tidy when all mixed versions of a song can be found in a consistent location within its session folder.

But usually I also want to keep a folder of all recent mixes available for the client. Typically I'd do this by hand, but it can be easy to make mistakes by forgetting to copy a new bounce of a song into the folder, or having to folder-dive to verify that all mixes are the most recent.

Well, no more. We hold so much in our heads as creative professionals working on a project that to offload a little strain on our brains, no matter how small, is beneficial. Why not respect our own time and mental energy by automating away anything we can?

As you can tell I built this primarily with my specific use case in mind, so if you have an idea that would make it more useful in more situations, feel free to submit a feature request!
